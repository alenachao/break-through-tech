### Week 3: Training ML Models
KNNs, decision trees

### Week 4: Linear Models
Logistic regression, linear regression

### Week 5: Evaluating and Deploying Models
Model selection, validation, feature selection, evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, AUC-ROC curves), model deployment

### Week 6: Ensemble Methods and Unsupervised learning
Ensemble methods, random forests, gradient boosting, clustering

### Week 7: Deep Lerning and Computer Vision
